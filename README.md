# Telecommunication-Systems-1-TEL-302

This repository contains the projects we developed during the academic year **2020â€“2021** for the course **Telecommunication Systems 1**.  
These projects were completed and submitted in partial fulfillment of the course requirements.

## Projects and Grades

- Project 1: 130/130

- Project 2: 115/130

- Project 3: 90/130

## Notes
- The code reflects our work and understanding during that period of study.
- The maximum grade is 100, but the assignments offered 30 bonus points, which is why the final grade is calculated out of 130.
